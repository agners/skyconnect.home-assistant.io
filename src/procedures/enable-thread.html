    <p>This guide assumes you have the following setup:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Connected SkyConnect.</li>
      <li>Home Assistant OS installation.</li>
      <li>Multiprotocol support disabled: Refer to the <a href="/procedures/disable-multiprotocol/">Disable multiprotocol support</a> procedure.</li>
      <li class="info">This guide installs a firmware which supports only Thread! If you use your SkyConnect
        to control Zigbee devices, you will no longer be able to control them after installing the Thread
        firmware. Use a second SkyConnect or the Multiprotocol support (experimental).
      </li>
      <li class="warning">Home Assistant Supervised: The Thread border router has some specific requirements
        on IPv6 configuration (e.g. IPv6 routing and prefix delegation support). This should be mostly met on a
        regular Debian installation, but this is not well tested by the developers. If you experience connectivity
        issue, try using a Home Assistant OS installation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    This guide outlines the step to install the OpenThread RCP (Radio Co-Processor) firmware for
